# THE GECKO 3DS PROJECT
This app will try to patch cia/3ds files to load codes with gct 

Will this work with gct? ✅ yep it will  (we might have to use a other file type)
Does region matter? ✅ it matters still
Will this work for other games besides mk7? ❌it wont work

The default_icon.png is kept secret for now 
Anyway all rights go to Nuke/brkirch/Y.S/Kenobi for making the great wii version but since they are almost all gone we will do this. 
Once this is released only Very small codes will be released for reasons
Menu buttons that will be on there if possibe 
Here are  the buttons that will be in the app (Select game on 3ds) this will patch a game that is on your 3ds menu.(Select game on sd) this will patch a game that is on your sd ONLY USE IF YOU HAVE THE GAME. And of course the wii style settings menu. Thats all of my ideas today hope for the best to come with this.
(UPDATE) this might not be made due to the command line work and the off-sets 
Where to get things https://github.com/MP2E/Gecko-OS  and https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib
Also the first goal is to make the app read the game id
the second goal is to make the program to make the cheat code file
